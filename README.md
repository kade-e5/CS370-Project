# CS370-Project
This is a repository for a Raspberry Pi Project for CS370 at Colorado State University Fall 2023

This repository features code for a baby monitor to run off of the Raspberry Pi 4 using a flask server for live video streaming.
Our code is derived from Gary Explains's repository https://github.com/garyexplains/examples/tree/master/RPiCameraPython and utilizes picamera, and socketservers in order to stream a live video feed from a camera.
